Project: Recipes

This repository hosts a simple recipe website created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The project focuses on building foundational HTML skills by structuring a basic website with a homepage linking to individual recipe pages. No CSS styling is applied at this stage; the emphasis is on semantic HTML, proper file organization, and navigation.

This exercise reinforces HTML boilerplate, headings, lists, links, and images while encouraging good Git practices like frequent commits.
